                    shall take place in Denver, Colorado, USA, and may be conducted by telephone or

                    jurisdiction for enforcement. Enforcements of any award or judgment shall be

                <p>
                  Some Web browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" feature that signals to websites
                  that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Each
                  browser communicates "Do Not Track" signals to websites differently, making it
                  unworkable to honor each and every request correctly. In order to alleviate any
                  communication error between browsers and websites, we do not respond to "Do Not
                  Track" signals at this time. As the technology and communication between browser
                  and website improves, we will reevaluate the ability to honor "Do Not Track"
                  signals and may make changes to our policy.
